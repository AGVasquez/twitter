# Welcome to this coding challenge!

## Instructions
- Fork this repo. You will need to send a PR after the interview.
- Clone the fork on your computer.
- Make sure there are no errors while installing the dependencies and starting the server.
- Go over the [issues tab](https://github.com/nicolas-amabile/twitter/issues) on the original repo.
- Take your time to choose an open issue, read the description carefully, and make sure there are no dependencies (there might be some related issues that you will need to solve first).
- Start working on it in your local environment (while sharing the screen, at least the IDE).

## Notes
- All resources are available (Google, StackOverflow, official documentation, blog posts, you name it).
- Feel free to install any other dependency that helps you solve the issue.
- Warnings: There are some warnings and bad practices in this codebase. You can ignore those warnings **if** they are not closely related to the issue you are currently working on.
- Refactors: There are specific issues for refactors, **but** if at any point in time you believe there is a better way to do something, feel free to refactor the code (eg: class-based components -> functional component)

Happy coding and good luck! ðŸ¤“
